## Development Update
- Adding Multi-Threading for Simultaneous Operations
- Will Look into CPU Max Thread Count Limits

# SSH-Py-Interop
SSH-Py-Interop

This is a seamless buildout for Controls of a 'Beowulf' ( Ie: Large Mass Of Servers ). Though Term-Menu is used as an Interrupt, the design is scalable to Intelligent Code & Low-Level Communication. I would like to explore a C++ Interop between MQTT and the like. However, said exploration defeats the simple ease of SSH. Please Automate with Care as that version has only be conceptualized in theory while developing this program.

### Usage:
python3 __main__.py

1. Ensure Your CSV's are in place
2. Capsulate Auth in OpenSSL Accordingly ( Not Implemented )
3. Alter Command Structure To OutFit Needs
4. Ex: ssh 1337@rpiMiner1876.localhost.com && cgminer NULL NULL
5. Ex: ssh 1337@rpiMiner1876.localhost.com && sudo systemctl restart cgminer.service
6. Ex: ssh 1337@rpiMiner1876.localhost.com && cat /var/log/cgminer.stats.out

### Design Purpose:
1. Lazily Control My Rpi Farm
2. Scale To Control Bitcoin Miner Farm
3. ( May Your Imagination Run Wild )

### Plan & Spec:
6-Months

### Research:
4-Weeks

### Development:
Some 'ThreeOdd' Sleepless Weeks Between Work

### Development:
See MIT License

### Refactoring:
